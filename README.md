# ZeroKit

A small framework that provides generic functionality to my Mac OS X (and perhaps even iPhone) projects.

# What if I find a bug, or what if I want to help?

Please, contact me with any questions, comments, suggestions, or problems. I try to make the time to answer every request.

Those wishing to contribute to the project should begin by obtaining the latest source with Git. The project is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for anyone to make contributions. Simply create a fork and make your changes.
